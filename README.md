# What's the CLI-Tools?

The CLI-Tools is just an app built for generic tasks such as gathering data about the weather, using a calculator, and other tasks all in the command-line interface of your
operational system, either it is a popular OS or not. So you won't be bothered by annoying differences between CLI's interface (those who have faced this situation before know how this can be irritating).

# How to use

As I'm still developing the app, I'm not able yet to give you a tour on the app, but don't worry, this'll be one of my biggest priorities for the future.
